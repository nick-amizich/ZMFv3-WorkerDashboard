### Page Components

## Theme Support
- The application already has proper dark mode support with CSS variables defined in `/src/app/globals.css`
- Theme toggle is available in navigation components
- Theme provider is properly configured with system preference detection

## Remaining Issues to Address

### High Priority (User-Facing)
1. Badge components with hardcoded colors (green-100, yellow-100, etc.) - found in:
   - `/src/app/manager/qc-submissions/qc-submissions-client.tsx`
   - `/src/app/manager/orders/production-assignment.tsx`
   - `/src/app/manager/automation/page.tsx`

2. Text colors - 172 instances of `text-gray-500`, `text-gray-600`, `text-gray-400` that should be replaced with `text-muted-foreground`

3. Background colors in various components still using `bg-gray-100`, `bg-white`, etc.

### Recommendations
1. Create semantic color variables for status indicators (success, warning, error, info)
2. Use opacity modifiers with primary colors instead of fixed color shades
3. Ensure all new components use theme-aware classes from the start

## Theme-Aware Classes Reference
- Backgrounds: `bg-background`, `bg-card`, `bg-muted`, `bg-accent`
- Text: `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `text-card-foreground`
- Borders: `border-border`, `border-input`, `border-muted`
- Interactive: `bg-primary`, `text-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`
