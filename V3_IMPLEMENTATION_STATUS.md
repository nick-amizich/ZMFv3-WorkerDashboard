   - ⏳ Worker checkpoint completion modal needs testing
   - ⏳ Integration with task workflow

2. **Predictive Quality Alerts**
   - ✅ Component created
   - ✅ Basic prediction logic
   - ⏳ Historical data analysis needs refinement
   - ⏳ Alert acknowledgment system

3. **Automation Rules**
   - ✅ UI created
   - ✅ Basic rule creation
   - ⏳ Quality-based triggers need implementation
   - ⏳ Rule execution engine needs testing

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

1. **Advanced Features**
   - ❌ Wood grain photo matching for L/R pairing
   - ❌ Voice notes for inspections
   - ❌ Photo capture for defects
   - ❌ Environmental monitoring dashboard

2. **Integrations**

## 📊 Implementation Progress

- **Core Features**: 85% complete
- **User Interface**: 90% complete
- **API Endpoints**: 80% complete
- **Database Schema**: 100% complete
- **Testing**: 20% complete
- **Documentation**: 70% complete

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **Type Safety**
   - Some API responses need proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Database types need to be regenerated after migration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Need comprehensive error boundaries
   - Better offline support for workers

3. **Performance**
   - Component search could use pagination
   - Real-time updates need WebSocket implementation

4. **Testing**
   - No unit tests written yet
   - Integration tests needed
   - E2E test suite required

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - Complete quality checkpoint integration
   - Test user management flows end-to-end
   - Fix any TypeScript errors
   - Basic testing of all features

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Implement photo/voice capture
   - Add Slack integration
   - Complete automation engine
   - Write comprehensive tests

3. **Long Term (Month 2)**
   - Machine learning features
   - Advanced analytics
   - Full gamification system
   - Performance optimization

## 🎯 Production Readiness

**Current Status**: 75% ready for production

**Blockers**:
- Need thorough testing of all workflows
- Performance testing required
- Security audit needed
- User training materials

**Recommendation**: 
The system is functionally complete for basic V3 operations. With 1-2 weeks of testing and bug fixes, it should be ready for a phased production rollout.
