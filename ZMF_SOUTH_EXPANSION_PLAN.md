# ZMF-South Machine Shop Expansion Plan

## Executive Summary
The ZMF-South expansion will create a specialized machine shop management system that seamlessly integrates with the existing ZMFv3 Worker Dashboard. This system will handle CNC machining operations for headphone cups and baffles while maintaining full visibility and coordination with the North facility's assembly operations.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Seamless Integration**: Leverage existing authentication, worker management, and order systems
2. **Specialized Features**: Add machine shop-specific functionality without disrupting current operations
3. **Real-time Coordination**: Enable cross-facility visibility and communication
4. **Minimal Duplication**: Reuse existing components and extend only where necessary
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Design for future multi-location expansion

## üîó Integration Strategy

### Shared Systems (No Duplication)
- **Authentication**: Use existing Supabase auth with location-based permissions
- **Workers Table**: Add `primary_location` field to existing workers table
- **Orders/Order Items**: Shared order pool with location-based filtering
- **Notification System**: Extend existing system for cross-location alerts
- **QC Framework**: Adapt existing QC system for machining-specific checks

### Extended Systems
- **Work Tasks**: Add `location_id` and `machine_id` fields
- **Work Batches**: Add `manufacturing_location` field
- **Component Tracking**: Add machining-specific fields (material_batch, cnc_program_version)
- **Time Logs**: Already location-aware through worker assignment

### New Systems (ZMF-South Specific)
1. **Machine Shop Tables** (as outlined in your spec)
2. **Material Inventory Management**
3. **CNC Program Version Control**
4. **Cross-Facility Transfer Tracking**

## üìä Database Schema Extensions

### 1. Location Management
```sql
-- Add to existing schema
ALTER TABLE workers ADD COLUMN primary_location text DEFAULT 'north';
ALTER TABLE work_tasks ADD COLUMN location_id uuid REFERENCES locations(id);
ALTER TABLE work_tasks ADD COLUMN machine_id uuid REFERENCES machines(id);
ALTER TABLE work_batches ADD COLUMN manufacturing_location text;

-- New table
CREATE TABLE locations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  code text UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- 'north', 'south'
  address text,
  timezone text DEFAULT 'America/New_York',
  active boolean DEFAULT true
);
```

### 2. Inter-Facility Transfers
```sql
CREATE TABLE facility_transfers (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  batch_id uuid REFERENCES work_batches(id),
  from_location uuid REFERENCES locations(id),
  to_location uuid REFERENCES locations(id),
  transfer_type enum ('components', 'materials', 'finished_goods'),
  quantity integer NOT NULL,
  status enum ('pending', 'in_transit', 'received', 'cancelled'),
  shipped_date timestamp,
  received_date timestamp,
  tracking_number text,
  notes text,
  created_by uuid REFERENCES workers(auth_user_id),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

### 3. Machine Shop Specific Tables
[Use tables from your specification with these additions:]
- Add RLS policies for location-based access
- Add audit triggers for all tables
- Add indexes for common queries
- Integration fields for existing systems

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Plan

### Subdomain Structure
- **Main App**: app.zmfheadphones.com (existing)
- **South Facility**: south.zmfheadphones.com (new)
- **Shared API**: api.zmfheadphones.com (enhanced)

### Technical Approach
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Keep both apps in same repository
2. **Shared Components**: Create packages for shared UI/logic
3. **Environment-Based Config**: Use env vars for location-specific settings
4. **Shared Database**: Single Supabase instance with RLS
5. **Real-time Updates**: Leverage existing Supabase realtime

### Folder Structure
```
/ZMFv3-WorkerDashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/          (existing app)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ south/         (new machine shop app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-ui/     (common components)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/      (shared types & queries)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ business-logic/(shared functions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/    (unified migrations)
```
