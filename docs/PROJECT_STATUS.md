```
Manager invites worker → Worker registers with token → Auto-approved → Can start working
OR
Worker registers → Pending approval → Manager approves → Worker activated
```

### 2. Quality Workflow
```
Order imported → Batch created → Component tracked → 
Worker scans QR → Completes checkpoint → Quality recorded →
Analytics updated → Patterns detected → Alerts generated
```

### 3. Manager Oversight
```
View dashboards → Monitor quality → Manage holds →
Approve workers → Set automation rules → Generate reports
```
