## 🚨 **CRITICAL FINAL STEP** 

### **Fix Email Confirmation Redirects (MUST DO)**

The localhost redirect issue is because Supabase still has localhost configured. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: kjdicpudxqxenhjwdrzg
3. **Go to**: Settings → General → Site URL
4. **Change Site URL** from `http://localhost:3000` to `https://zmf.randomtask.us`
5. **Go to**: Authentication → URL Configuration
6. **Add Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://zmf.randomtask.us/auth/callback`
   - `https://zmf.randomtask.us/login`
   - `https://zmf.randomtask.us/manager/dashboard`
   - `https://zmf.randomtask.us/worker/dashboard`

## 🧪 **Testing the Complete Flow**

### Test Registration & Email Confirmation:
1. Go to `https://zmf.randomtask.us/register`
2. Fill out the form with a real email
3. Submit - should see beautiful success screen
4. Check email for confirmation link
5. Click link - should redirect to production site (not localhost!)
6. Should land on login page with success message

### Test Authentication Flow:
1. Login with confirmed account
2. Should redirect to appropriate dashboard based on role
3. Verify all features work in production
