# QC Checklist Implementation Summary

## Overview
A temporary quality control checklist system has been implemented for headphone production workers. This mobile-friendly solution allows workers to complete quality checks digitally for each production step.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `qc_submissions` table with:
  - Worker information (ID and name)
  - Production step tracking
  - Checklist items stored as JSONB
  - Product information (model, serial number, wood type)
  - Submission timestamps
  - RLS policies for security

### 2. Worker Features

#### QC Checklist Page (`/worker/qc-checklist`)
- **Worker Selection**: Dropdown for selecting worker (managers can select any worker)
- **Step Selection**: 13 production steps covering the entire workflow
- **Dynamic Checklist**: Automatically loads relevant checklist items for each step
- **Product Information**: Optional fields for model, serial number, and wood type
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion status
- **Auto-save**: Uses localStorage to persist progress between sessions
- **Mobile Responsive**: Large touch targets and mobile-friendly interface
- **Notes**: Can add notes to individual items or overall submission

#### Navigation Updates
- Added "QC Checklist" to worker navigation menu
- Added quick access card on worker dashboard with green theme

### 3. Manager Features

#### QC Submissions View (`/manager/qc-submissions`)
- **Filter Options**: 
  - By worker
  - By production step
  - By date range
- **Submission List**: Shows all QC submissions with:
  - Worker name and submission time
  - Completion status (X/Y items complete)
  - Product information
  - Expandable checklist details
- **Export**: CSV export functionality for reporting
- **Notes Display**: Shows both item-specific and overall notes

#### Navigation Updates
- Added "QC Submissions" under Quality menu in manager navigation

### 4. API Endpoints

#### `/api/qc/workers`
- GET: Fetches list of active workers for dropdown

#### `/api/qc/submissions`
- POST: Creates new QC submission with validation
- GET: Fetches submissions with filtering options

### 5. Key Features

- **Offline Capability**: Uses localStorage to save progress
- **Validation**: Ensures all checklist items are completed before submission
- **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation when checklist is submitted
- **Auto-reset**: Form clears after successful submission for next unit
- **Role-based Access**: Workers see their own submissions, managers see all
