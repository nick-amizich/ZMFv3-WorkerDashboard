# Webpack Module Error Fix Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
You're seeing this error in the dev server:
```
⨯ Error: Cannot find module './4447.js'
```

This is a **Next.js webpack hot reload issue**, not a Supabase connection problem.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes (In Order of Preference)

### 1. Clear Next.js Cache (Safest)
```bash
# Stop dev server first (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 2. Clear Node Modules (If #1 doesn't work)
```bash
# Stop dev server first
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Restart Docker (If still having issues)
```bash
# Stop dev server first
docker restart $(docker ps -q)
supabase stop
supabase start
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Verification Steps
After applying fixes, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check Supabase is running
supabase status

# 2. Test build
npm run build

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Test pages
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/south
# Should return: 307 (redirect to login - this is correct!)
```

## 🎯 Root Cause
This error typically happens when:
- Next.js webpack cache gets corrupted
- Hot reload tries to load a module that was renamed/moved
- Fast refresh encounters a runtime error and can't recover

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't modify webpack config
- ❌ Don't change Next.js version
- ❌ Don't modify Supabase setup
- ❌ Don't reset database

## 💡 Prevention
- Clear `.next` folder when switching branches
- Restart dev server after major code changes
- Use `npm run build` to catch issues early
