# V3 Implementation Status

## Overview
V3 adds comprehensive quality control features to the ZMF Worker Dashboard, including component tracking, quality intelligence, and automation rules.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **UI Components**
   - Quality Analytics Dashboard (`quality-analytics-dashboard.tsx`)
   - Quality Reporting Suite (`quality-reporting-suite.tsx`)
   - Automation Rule Builder (`automation-rule-builder.tsx`)
   - Issue Reporting Modal (`issue-reporting-modal.tsx`)

2. **Database Migrations**
   - V3 Quality System tables (`20250131_v3_quality_system.sql`)
   - V3 Automation Rules tables (`20250130_v3_automation_rules.sql`)

3. **API Routes**
   - Issues reporting endpoint (`/api/issues/report`)
   - Quality holds endpoint (`/api/quality/holds`)
   - Analytics endpoints (`/api/analytics/*`)
   - Automation endpoints (`/api/automation/*`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Actions

1. **Database Types Generation**
   ```bash
   # Run this to update TypeScript types with v3 tables
   ./scripts/generate-types.sh
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Apply v3 migrations to database
   npx supabase db push
   ```

3. **Fix Migration References**
   The v3 quality system migration references "employees" table but the actual table is "workers". 
   Need to update the migration file to use correct table references.

### üîß Temporary Fixes Applied

1. **API Routes**: Modified to use `workers` table instead of non-existent `employees` table
2. **Quality Tables**: Added TODO comments where v3 tables are referenced but not yet in TypeScript types
3. **Type Errors**: Added type assertions where necessary to allow compilation

### üìã Next Steps

1. **Update Database Types**
   - Run the generate-types script after applying migrations
   - Remove temporary fixes and TODO comments

2. **Test Quality Features**
   - Component tracking workflow
   - Quality checkpoint system
   - Issue reporting and resolution
   - Quality analytics and patterns

3. **Complete Integration**
   - Connect quality UI components to live API endpoints
   - Implement real-time quality monitoring
   - Set up automation rule execution

## Known Issues

1. **Table Name Mismatch**: V3 migration uses "employees" in RLS policies but table is "workers"
2. **Missing Types**: TypeScript types don't include v3 tables until regenerated
3. **API Placeholders**: Some API endpoints return placeholder data until types are fixed

## Testing

Once database is updated:
1. Test issue reporting from worker dashboard
2. Verify quality holds creation and management
3. Check quality analytics data aggregation
4. Test automation rule creation and execution
