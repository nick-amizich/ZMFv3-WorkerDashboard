- See exactly what would happen before enabling a rule.

### **Key Components**
- **AutomationRuleTestPanel**
  - Select rule (dropdown/autocomplete)
  - Select context: Batch, Task, Stage (dropdowns, auto-populated)
  - Dry-run toggle
  - "Execute" button
  - Results display: Conditions evaluated, actions that would be taken, success/failure, logs

- **RecentManualExecutionsTable**
  - Shows recent manual/dry-run executions, who ran them, and results

---

## 4. **Automation Analytics & Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Purpose**
- Give managers a real-time overview of automation performance, bottlenecks, and recommendations.

### **Key Components**
- **AutomationSummaryStats**
  - Total rules, active rules, executions (30d), success rate, avg execution time

- **AutomationPerformanceCharts**
  - Line/bar charts: Executions per day, success/failure rates, average execution time
  - Pie chart: Rule types, trigger types

- **TopRulesTable**
  - Top performing rules (by execution count, success rate)
  - Slowest rules (by execution time)
  - Most failing rules (by failure rate)

- **AutomationRecommendationsPanel**
  - List of system-generated recommendations (e.g., "2 rules have high failure rates. Review conditions.")

- **RecentAutomationEventsFeed**
  - Stream of recent automation events: rule fired, actions taken, errors, manual overrides

---

## 5. **Automation Event Log & Audit Trail**

### **Purpose**
- Full searchable/filterable log of all automation executions, for audit and debugging.

### **Key Components**
- **AutomationEventLogTable**
  - Columns: Timestamp, Rule, Workflow, Trigger, Status, Actions Taken, Error (if any), Executed By, Context (batch/task)
  - Filters: By rule, workflow, status, date range, executed by
  - Export to CSV

- **AutomationEventDetailsModal**
  - Full JSON of execution context, conditions, actions, and results

---

## 6. **Automation Settings & Controls**

### **Purpose**
- Global settings for automation (e.g., enable/disable all, rate limits, notification preferences).

### **Key Components**
- **AutomationSettingsPanel**
  - Toggles: Enable all automation, enable notifications, set rate limits
  - Slack integration status
  - Default notification channels

# üìù **UX/Design Notes**

- Use shadcn/ui for all modals, drawers, tables, and forms.
- Use TanStack Table for large data tables (rules, logs).
- Use recharts or similar for analytics charts.
- All actions should have confirmation dialogs and error handling.
- All forms should use React Hook Form + Zod for validation.
- Support dark mode and mobile responsiveness.
- Use badges and color coding for rule status, trigger types, and errors.
- Provide tooltips and inline help for complex config fields.

---

# üö¶ **Testing & Monitoring**

- All UI should show real-time status (loading, error, success).
- Use optimistic updates for rule activation/deactivation.
- Show toast notifications for all actions (success/error).
- Provide links from analytics to rule details and logs.

---

# üèÅ **MVP Priorities**

1. **AutomationRulesTable** + **AutomationRuleForm** (CRUD)
2. **AutomationSummaryStats** + **PerformanceCharts**
3. **AutomationRuleTestPanel** (manual/dry-run)
4. **AutomationEventLogTable** (searchable log)
5. **AutomationTemplatesGallery** (optional for v1)

**This spec covers every backend feature built so far that does not have a UI. It's designed for rapid manager understanding, debugging, and optimization of the automation system.**
