# V3.1 Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
V3.1 focuses on fixing critical issues from V3 implementation and completing the quality control system integration. This is a stabilization release before moving to production.

## Critical Fixes Required

### 1. Database Migration Corrections (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: V3 migrations reference "employees" table in RLS policies, but the actual table is "workers"
**Impact**: Migrations will fail to apply, blocking all V3 features

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create migration patch file to fix table references
- [ ] Update all "employees" references to "workers" in:
  - `20250131_v3_quality_system.sql` (lines 139, 149, 162, 172, 184, 194, 207, 217, 227, 240, 249, 260, 270)
  - Verify no other migrations have this issue
- [ ] Test migration on fresh database

### 2. TypeScript Types Generation (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Database types don't include V3 tables (quality_checkpoints, component_tracking, etc.)
**Impact**: TypeScript errors preventing compilation

**Actions**:
- [ ] Apply corrected migrations to Supabase
- [ ] Run `./scripts/generate-types.sh` to update types
- [ ] Remove all temporary type assertions and TODO comments
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript errors in quality-related API routes

### 3. API Route Fixes (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Multiple API routes have placeholder data and incorrect table references
**Impact**: Quality features won't work properly

**Files to fix**:
- [ ] `/api/quality/checkpoints/route.ts` - Update to use correct tables
- [ ] `/api/quality/holds/route.ts` - Implement actual data queries
- [ ] `/api/quality/inspections/route.ts` - Connect to inspection_results table
- [ ] `/api/quality/patterns/route.ts` - Wire up quality_patterns table
- [ ] `/api/quality/predictive-alerts/route.ts` - Implement pattern analysis

## Critical Missing Feature: User Management

### 4. User Management System (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Users can sign up but there's no approval workflow or worker management
**Impact**: Cannot control who accesses the system or manage worker permissions

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Add to workers table
ALTER TABLE workers 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approval_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' 
  CHECK (approval_status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'suspended')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approved_by UUID REFERENCES workers(id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rejection_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS suspension_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS suspended_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Create worker invitations table
CREATE TABLE worker_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('worker', 'supervisor', 'manager')) NOT NULL,
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES workers(id) NOT NULL,
  invitation_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create user management page at `/manager/users`
- [ ] Build approval workflow:
  - List of pending registrations
  - One-click approve/reject with reasons
  - Email notifications on approval/rejection
- [ ] Worker management features:
  - Edit worker details (name, skills, hourly rate)
  - Change roles (worker/supervisor/manager)
  - Suspend/reactivate workers
  - View worker activity history
- [ ] Invitation system:
  - Send email invitations to new workers
  - Pre-approved registration via invite link
  - Set role and permissions before signup
- [ ] API endpoints:
  - `GET/POST /api/workers/pending` - List and approve pending users
  - `PUT /api/workers/[id]` - Update worker details
  - `POST /api/workers/invite` - Send invitations
  - `POST /api/workers/[id]/suspend` - Suspend/reactivate
- [ ] Security updates:
  - Update middleware to check approval_status
  - Redirect unapproved users to "pending approval" page
  - Add audit logging for all user management actions

**UI Components**:
```typescript
// User Management Dashboard
interface UserManagementDashboard {
  sections: {
    pendingApprovals: {
      count: number
      users: PendingUser[]
      actions: ['approve', 'reject', 'request_info']
    }
    activeWorkers: {
      count: number
      workers: Worker[]
      filters: ['role', 'skills', 'active_tasks']
      actions: ['edit', 'suspend', 'view_history']
    }
    invitations: {
      pending: Invitation[]
      actions: ['resend', 'cancel', 'copy_link']
    }
  }
}
```

## Feature Completion

### 5. Quality Checkpoint Integration (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Workers must complete quality checks before/after tasks

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Add checkpoint UI to worker task view
- [ ] Implement photo capture for checks requiring photos
- [ ] Add measurement input for dimensional checks
- [ ] Block task completion until required checks pass
- [ ] Store inspection results with proper component tracking

### 6. Component Tracking System (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Track individual headphone components through production

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create component registration flow
- [ ] Implement QR code generation for cup pairs
- [ ] Add component journey visualization
- [ ] Link components to tasks and quality results
- [ ] Build serial number generation system

### 7. Quality Analytics Dashboard (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Real-time quality metrics and insights

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Connect dashboard to real inspection data
- [ ] Implement first-pass yield calculations
- [ ] Create issue heatmaps by stage/worker

3. **User Adoption**: Provide extensive training materials
4. **Data Loss**: Implement comprehensive backups

## Next Steps After V3.1

Once V3.1 is stable:

2. V4.1: Customer portal for order tracking
3. V4.2: Supplier integration for material tracking
4. V5.0: Full ERP integration
